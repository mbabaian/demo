      There are several parts to your results that you need to know. 
      First, if you want to find a book that is available today, only look at the books that are marked "IN". 
      You don't want to waste your time looking for books that are marked "LOST" or "OUT". 
  - text: |
      Take a close look at the status of each book. Find one that is IN and click on it. 
      I'll be back in a few seconds to tell you more . . . 
  - wait: 2s
  - text: After clicking on a book, you'll see a new page that has more information about the book. Look for the book's call number. 
    typing: 1s
  - text: |
      The call number is like an address for a book--it tells you where the book "lives" on the shelves. 
      You use the call number to find the book on the shelf.
    typing: 1s
  - text: | 
      The first line of the call number is either a letter or a number. 
      If it starts with a number, like 741.5, that is a nonfiction book. 
      If it starts with a letter, like E or FIC, that's fiction.
    typing: 1s
  - text: |
      It's always a good idea to write down the call number on a small sheet of paper. 
      That way you don't forget what the call number during your hunt for books.

      If the call number starts with E, you have found a picture book!

      The second line of the call number comes from the author's last name.
